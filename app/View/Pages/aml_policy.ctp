            	        <h2>Anti Money Laundering Policy</h2>
            	        <p>
					    <b>Money laundering</b> is the act of converting money or other monetary instruments gained from illegal activity into money or investments that appear to be legitimate, so that its illegal source cannot be traced.
					    </p>

						<p>
						Domestic and international laws that apply to companies, whose customers can deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts, make it illegal for IK Trust  company, or its employees or agents, to knowingly engage, or attempt to engage in a monetary transaction of criminally derived property.
                        </p>

						<h4>Objective</h4>
						
						<p>
						The objective of Anti-Money laundering procedures that IK Trust implements is to ensure that customers engaging in certain activities are identified to a reasonable standard, while minimizing the compliance burden and impact on legitimate customers. IK Trust is committed to assisting governments combat the threat of money laundering and financing terrorist activities around the world. For that purpose IK Trust has set up a highly sophisticated electronic system. This system documents and verifies client identification records, and tracks and maintains detailed records of all transactions.
					    </p>
                        <p>
						IK Trust carefully tracks suspicious and significant transaction activities, and reports such activities "providing timely and comprehensive information" to law enforcement bodies.
